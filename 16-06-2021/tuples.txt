Array  : It is to store homogenious data (all the elements with same data type)
List  : We can store different elements with different data types
-> Mutable ( We can modify the list items ) 
-> Ordered ( We can access the elements with index )
-> Iterable ( We can iterate through each element ) 
-> []

Tuples:
-------------------
- We can store different data types
- Immutable
- Ordered
- Iterable
- ()
