## Day 7 loops 

to execute staments in a given sequence of time.

in python we have for and while:

## for loop syntax
```
for temp_var in Sequence_of_data:
  statements
 ```
Example for sequence of data is:
integers
string
List
tuple
Dictionary

### for integer sequence we need to use this range()
for generating integers values as a sequence here we have a in built function called `range()`

range(4) `--> 0,1,2,3` 4 is end value

range(1,4) `-->1,2,3` 

range(1,10,2) `--> 1,3,5,7,9`

### for strings
by default a string is iterable so we can directly generate sequence of characters by strings

## While Loop Syntax
```
init_value 
while condition:
  statements
  
  inc/dec
```

### termination conditions
- Break 
- Continue
